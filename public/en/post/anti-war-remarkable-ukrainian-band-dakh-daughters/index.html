<p><strong>The human toll of the conflict is staggering.</strong></p>
<p>Political leaders worldwide should be ashamed of themselves as the first anniversary of the Russo-Ukrainian War approaches. It is a tragedy that the people and soldiers always lose, regardless of which side claims victory. Shockingly, according to Reuters&rsquo; data, almost 15,000 people have died, 60,000 have been injured, and over 1.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the ongoing conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Genuine voice of Anti-war.</strong></p>
<p>The members of the Ukrainian band Dahk Daughters are also among the many victims of this devastating war. Their live performing video, recorded in Normandy, France, expresses their anger and desperation through the use of strings, keyboards, percussion, and vocals. Despite the language barrier (the songs are written and performed in Ukrainian), their message resonates powerfully with audiences. The song lyrics are translated as follows:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The house is cold, and the stomach is empty.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Following the priest from house to house, death comes reaping the gifts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The priest with his pocket empty, death was dying under the weight of it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The demon playing the fiddle behind it, stamping on the corpses.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;CAW! CAW! CAW!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Nuclear crisis is lingering</strong>.</p>
<p>It is hard to fathom that Putin announced Russia&rsquo;s decision to suspend the New Start nuclear arms treaty, which limits the number of nuclear warheads held by Russia and the U.S. and gives each country the power to inspect the other. With Russia withdrawing from this treaty, a nuclear crisis looms large. Will World War III break out, resulting in the deaths of half the world&rsquo;s population or more? Is it possible that WWIII will be the last war? The answers to these questions are unimaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Support the art, stop the war.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to NPR global fest, the world can hear the genuine voice of artists like Dakh Daughters. It is a shame that such a talented band was unknown to me until recently. If Putin can boldly declare that Russia is breaking the parity, then there is no reason why we cannot express our strong desire for freedom through music. Therefore, I urge you to discover more great works by artists like Dakh Daughters and share them with others.</p>
<p>Finally, it is my pleasure to inform you that Dakh Daughters will be touring in France and North America later this March. You can check their tour schedule here: <a href="https://dakhdaughters.com/"></a><a href="https://dakhdaughters.com/">https://dakhdaughters.com/</a>.</p>
